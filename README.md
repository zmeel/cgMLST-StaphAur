# Prokka annoted genes of the cgMSLT scheme of Enterococcus faecium
<br>
The Staphylococcus aureus reference strain (for the SeqSphere+ cgMLST scheme) consists of x sequences.
The cgMLST scheme itself consists of 1861 sequences.<br><br>

1. The [sequence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zmeel/cgMLST-StaphAur/main/NC_002951.2%20Staphylococcus%20aureus%20subsp.%20aureus%20COL.fasta) of the reference strain Staphylococcus aureus COL was imported in SeqSphere+ and run throught the cgMLST scheme.<br>
2. The [results](https://github.com/zmeel/cgMLST-StaphAur/blob/main/S.%20aureus_cgMLST_scheme.fasta) were exported and later used in ChatGPT<br>
3. The [sequence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zmeel/cgMLST-StaphAur/main/NC_002951.2%20Staphylococcus%20aureus%20subsp.%20aureus%20COL.fasta) of the reference strain Staphylococcus aureus COL was also uploaded to Galaxy and Prokka was run to annotate the whole genome.
